I am a B.Tech student specializing in Data Science with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, and Power BI. I enjoy working with data to uncover meaningful insights through data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Alongside analytics, I have experience with creative tools like Photoshop, Figma, and Canva, which helps me present data and ideas through clear, impactful visuals and presentations.
